## Learning How To Learn
This class was particularly interesting to me because despite all my coursework I never quite figured out a learning process that worked for me.  I pummeled my way through classes with bad habits, procrastinations, and all-nighters.  Since my learning focus revolves around programming this final project is a github page with my key takeaways and other notes that I will use as a reference in the future.

### Key Takeaways
#### Spaced Repetition
The analogies with excercise were a bit of a lightbulb moment for me.  Spaced-repetition works exactly the same for learning and memory as it does for excercise:
1. No weight lifter would ever wait until the last minute for a competition then attempt to spend all night weight lifting (or "Cramming") as practice and expect to win their competition the next day.
2. No marathon runner would ever procrastinate their practice until the last day and have any expectation of doing well in the marathon.

#### Breaks
Taking breaks while working or studying is not a personal failure to study or focus.  In fact quite the opposite, it is literally part of the learning process.1. It changes the mode of the brain from Focused to Diffuse, where many of the new neural pathways are formed and connected to other areas of the brain.  
2. It is when learning can take place, analogous to the resting time of a workout which is when the body gets stronger.
3. Using breaks as a reward mechanism actually enhances your ability to truly focus while studying in the focused mode.

#### Mnemonics
Mnemonics are not just a "hack" or a cheap poor mans way to remember something, it is literally _how the brain learns_.  I once thought this wasn't "real" learning. In fact, it is _difficult_ for the brain to create new familiar patterns that can be recalled easily, which requires spaced repetition; repeated practice over time.  It is _easy_ for the brain to piggyback on existing neural patterns and attach a "hook" that references new information.
1. All of the memory experts interviewed used mnemonics; typically associating words with pictures, but songs, smells, and even touch is possible.
2. The more outrageous the association / picture, the more likely you are to remember it.
