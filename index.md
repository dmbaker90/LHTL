## Learning How To Learn
This class was particularly interesting to me because despite all my coursework I never quite figured out a learning process that worked for me.  I pummeled my way through classes with bad habits, procrastinations, and all-nighters.  Since my learning focus revolves around programming this final project is a github page with my key takeaways and other notes that I will use as a reference in the future.

### Key Takeaways

#### Spaced Repetition
The analogies with excercise were a bit of a lightbulb moment for me.  Spaced-repetition works exactly the same for learning and memory as it does for excercise:
1. No weight lifter would ever wait until the last minute for a competition then attempt to spend all night weight lifting (or "Cramming") as practice and expect to win their competition the next day.
2. No marathon runner would ever procrastinate their practice until the last day and have any expectation of doing well in the marathon.
3. "Chunking" is the process of grouping similar material into a single chunk.  For instance, it is difficult to remember a 9 digit phone number 1 digit at a time, but it's easy to split it up into 3 section and remember 3 longer numbers.  This is consistent with the idea that our working memory only has room for 4 chunks at a time.
    - "Chunking" complex topics actually helps the brain learn new topics in different areas through a process called Transfer.
        - One interview with a Standford professor discussed how building an understanding of solving mathematical equations helps the brain create problem solving processes that help in all other fields as well.
    - The process involved in making a chunk is 
        1. Deliberate Focus - possibly through the Pomodoro technique
        2. Understanding the basic idea
        3. Practice

#### Breaks
Taking breaks while working or studying is not a personal failure to study or focus.  In fact quite the opposite, it is literally part of the learning process.
1. It changes the mode of the brain from Focused to Diffuse, where many of the new neural pathways are formed and connected to other areas of the brain.  
2. It is when learning can take place, analogous to the resting time of a workout which is when the body gets stronger.
3. Using breaks as a reward mechanism actually enhances your ability to truly focus while studying in the focused mode.

#### Mnemonics
Mnemonics are not just a "hack" or a cheap poor mans way to remember something, it is literally _how the brain learns_.  I once thought this wasn't "real" learning. In fact, it is _difficult_ for the brain to create new familiar patterns that can be recalled easily, which requires spaced repetition; repeated practice over time.  It is _easy_ for the brain to piggyback on existing neural patterns and attach a "hook" that references new information.
1. All of the memory experts interviewed used mnemonics; typically associating words with pictures, but songs, smells, and even touch is possible.
2. The more outrageous the association / picture, the more likely you are to remember it.

#### Procrastinating
1. We procrastinate things because thinking about the end Product (as opposed to the "Process") triggers the same area of the brain that processes pain.
2. It takes more willpower to constantly procrastinate that it does to make the initial leap to start a process.
3. After you begin what you were procrastinating, you discover that it's never as bad as you feared anyway and the expected discomfort was unwarranted.
4. Procrastinating shares charactaristics with addiction, and can build a self destructive cycle of continuously avoiding the things we think are uncomfortable.
5. The process to eliminate procrastination involves 4 steps: 
    - Cues: notice what it is that causes the distractions and eliminate them.  Most office these are phones, or notifications on your computer.
    - Routine: build a new plan that breaks bad cues and encourages new cues with fewer distractions.  Neurological routines are powerful.
    - Reward: after a successful focused mode of studying, reward yourself with an appropriate sized reward.  This isn't just psychological, it's also part of the learning process to break away from the focused mode of the brain.  Consider the Pomodorow (tomato timer) technique to focus for 25 minutes, then a 5 minute break into the diffuse mode of the brain.
    - Belief: _belief_ that the new system works reinforces the behavior that you will use it.
